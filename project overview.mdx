Join us in uncovering how Japanese print illustrators viewed their landscape during the Tokugawa period (1603–1868). Our platform invites you to participate in research that combines public participation with artificial intelligence to map and analyze historical Japanese landscapes as depicted in woodblock prints (ukiyo-e).

### The Project

Our project, **“Drawing from the Crowd: A Citizen Science Platform for Mapping Ukiyo-e Geography,”** is one of five selected 2024 Nippon Social Innovator’s Collaboration (NSIC) projects. The six-month project, funded by The Nippon Foundation, combines academic research and citizen science to bridge these two spheres and enhance awareness of geographic circumstances and how they change over time.

This project aligns with Sustainable Development Goals **4: Quality Education** and **11: Sustainable Communities.** Currently functioning as a prototype, we are seeking long-term funding to demonstrate how citizen-generated data in academic research can bridge the digital divide between humanity and its digital environment, particularly in the age of artificial intelligence.

### Goals
- **Build Community through Citizen Science:** Foster appreciation for Japanese local histories and awareness of the natural environment at local and international levels.
- **Grow Knowledge Among Project Members:** Enhance expertise in interdisciplinary, multilingual research projects at the intersection of history and digital humanities.
- **Refine Japanese Print Scholarship:** Establish a research methodology to assess how print illustrators perceived landscapes and how views changed with increased travel opportunities. This contributes to understanding which realities the prints represent.

## Our Mission

To create an engaging, accessible platform where people interested in Japanese landscapes and culture can contribute their knowledge and insights to help us understand how print illustrators observed and depicted their environment. Through collaborative mapping and analysis, we aim to distinguish between prints based on direct observation and those inspired by visual traditions.

### How You Can Contribute

We need your help in:
- Identifying geographical features in historic prints.
- Matching historical views with modern-day locations.
- Comparing artistic depictions with actual topography.

## Research Framework

Our project addresses two key questions:
1. How can we collectively identify which print features are based on direct landscape observation and which are rooted in visual traditions and templates?
2. What can this tell us about how print illustrators and the public in the Tokugawa period viewed and represented their environment?

## Platform Features

While currently under construction, our platform will include:
- A **bilingual interface** (Japanese/English).
- **Interactive mapping tools** for comparing prints with topological elevation models and other landscape visualizations.
- **Educational resources** about Japanese landscapes in visual culture.
- **Community features** for sharing discoveries and engaging in research and discussions.
- **AI-assisted tools** to support analysis.

## Data and Resources

We work with:
- A growing collection of digitized prints from institutions like the [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York](https://www.metmuseum.org/) and the [Art Research Center at Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto](https://www.arc.ritsumei.ac.jp/).
- Modern Japanese terrain data from the [Geospatial Information Authority of Japan](https://fgd.gsi.go.jp/).
- Advanced AI vision models for image analysis
