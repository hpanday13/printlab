# Our Team and Partners

Our interdisciplinary team, including **Dr. Stephanie Santschi**, **Dr. Drew Richardson**, **Dr. Himanshu Panday**, and graduate student **Tsuji Hirohito**, brings a wealth of expertise in digital humanities, spatial histories, and art history. We are working to adapt existing spatial analysis and participatory science methods to meet the needs of Japanese citizen scientists, shaping our platform’s user interface. This comprehensive approach ensures that our project is well-equipped to meet its goals.

## Project Leadership

### Dr. Stephanie Santschi
**Project Governance, Publishing, Networking**  
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Japanese art history at the University of Zurich’s Chair in East Asian Art History. As my research centers on the representation of Japanese geography in early modern visual culture, and because I strongly advocate for citizen science as part of computational methods for humanities research, I see this research community as a means of connecting academic research and public interest.  
**Contact:** [stephanie@theprintlab.org](mailto:stephanie@theprintlab.org)

### Research Partners

#### Dr. Drew Richardson
**Team Collaborator**  
I am an instructor for Cowell College and the Department of History at the University of California Santa Cruz, where I also serve as the Director for Curriculum Development in the Okinawa Memories Initiative. My research examines media and place-making practices in native Japanese ethnography, folklore, and monsters.

#### Himanshu Panday
**Digital Prototyping, Coding, AI-Assisted Workflows**  
I am a digital anthropologist and AI-supported citizen science platform developer. My interests lie in curating and exploring new algorithms for citizen science on this project.

#### Hirohito Tsuji, PhD Candidate
**Networking, Background Research, and Japanese Translations**  
I am a PhD candidate at the University of East Anglia specializing in the Imperial Family of Japan. My interests include Japanese history, culture, arts, geography, and Japanese studies from the perspective of digital humanities.
